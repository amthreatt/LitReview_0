\section{Problem Context}
Every year California Public School and Charter School students, third to eighth grade and eleventh grade, take a standardized test. This test covers English language arts and mathematics. Of those two subjects, they get broken down into a few categories to create a well-rounded exam to assess how well the students are learning new material accurately. These test results have continually shown that students perform better in English language arts instead of Mathematics. This noticeable trend brought common core math teaching to California schools; however, this disparity in test results still stands. \cite{noauthor_california_nodate}
 
There are several reasons why a student may struggle with math; many other learning differences can attribute to work to learn math, such as dyscalculia, dysgraphia, dyslexia, visual processing disorders, or add/ADHD much more that were not mentioned \cite{noauthor_why_nodate}. Along with those previously mentioned learning differences, math anxiety is an issue some students can suffer from without having a learning difference attached to it. Essentially everyone who struggles with math struggles differently from the next person. However, there are identifiable fundamentals where the challenges lie.  
 
Many different teaching techniques have been designed to best help students in and outside of class with the education of math and other subjects. One way of teaching is a sort of the modified Orton Gillingham methodology adapted for mathematics teaching and a focus of evidence-based instruction. Orton and Gillingham were researchers who focused on reading struggles, and language processing disorders, along with dyslexia, they together created a set of teaching principles. The Orton-Gillingham approach is a “direct, explicit, multisensory, structured, sequential, diagnostic, and perspective way to teach literacy when reading, writing, and spelling” \cite{ahearn_what_2016}. The Orton-Gillingham method was designed for reading and writing; however, educators have begun implementing this approach into maths teaching. In math teaching the methodology starts by creating concrete examples for students so creating more hands-on examples when teaching, and then finally converting what they have learned into math symbols and numbers. Essentially the OG approach in math does use the multisensory aspect with the concrete examples, but along with that the teaching is data-driven, it will implement direct connections between previous material and new material, and immediate feedback \cite{noauthor_why_nodate}. Along with the OG methodology, there is evidence-based math teaching that has been helping develop the way math is taught. Evidence-based math has four main focuses: explicit instruction, visual representation, schema-based instruction, and peer interaction \cite{noauthor_evidence-based_nodate}. The aspect of evidence-based teaching that can be applied to virtual tutoring will be explicit instruction which is a way of making the learning process very clear; this helps students not have to guess what to do as often. Breaking down a problem into clear and identifiable steps can be helpful for students who cannot retain everything at once. As well as the evidence-based instruction a website provides the option to also implement visual representations as well. 
Online tutoring is not new, especially due to the pandemic there has been a lot of services that have transferred online. With most typical online tutoring services, there is a cost attached, but with that being said you are provided with live one on one tutoring. However, the price of these services recessed the accessibility to math education aids, although a website is not a person have access to a free and comprehensive response to a student input can be helpful when a one on one tutor is not an option. 
 
With all that said, the main points of math education I want to bring to this website are structured and sequential aspects from OG, along with the immediate feedback, and having clear and identifiable prompts for the student to help guide to the next step in an algebraic problem. But most importantly what I have taken from my research will be the visual aspects of the website. Typing math symbols into a computer have not always been so easy, but websites like Wolfram alpha have made great efforts to make mathematical user input much easier. 




\section{Technical Background}
The main algorithmic details of this website revolve around interpreting and organizing the user input, and then with that understanding how to use the information to best help the student. Wolfram Alpha for example is a powerful online calculator that with a premium subscription provides step by step details for a problem. To provide the step by step information as well as preform the computations the website uses its own programming language in combination with Mathematica. However this is not the approach all online calculators use, and is not the approach that will be used for this new website. Due to the capacity of the website the user is confined to only inputting quadratic, or just simple algebra problems. With that being said the step by stem functionality of the website can be implemented by converting the equation to a tree data structure.   

In the wolfram programming cloud, it uses its own language; however, it gives access to a number of mathematical tools that will be helpful in the creating of this website. The wolfram language is said to be the only full scale computational language; the language already has a number of complex algorithms worked into it, making high level computation much easier. Although the website planned does not require high level computation, it will require a lot of small computations after every input. 

However, the complexity of the calculation performed will not be extensive, I have decided to set the focus of this website on being able to take in any quadratic equation. The website will create specialized steps, prompts to guide the student and real-time checking of their inputs as they work towards the solution. With that being said, this website will be built using JavaScript. The construction of this website will be inspired by an online integral calculator website https://www.integral-calculator.com/. So similar to this website I will use JavaScript to create a parser to take the user input and configure it into a tree to then use to guide the students work with step by step prompts. With each prompt it will take in a user input, I will also be checking that input to make sure the student performed the math correctly as this step. To display the information and perform the computations I will use Maxima; this will help produce a clean output because Maxima works with \LaTeX. Lastly, to parse the input into a tree, I will use the Shunting-yard algorithm, this algorithm was created by Dijkstra  and utilizes stacks and queues to help shape the tree. The Shunting-yard algorithm essential runs through the input and if there is a number, or also variable it will get added to a queue. The operator is pushed onto the stack, the operator are continually pushed and popped to account for some operator having higher precedence over others. \cite{noauthor_shunting-yard_2022} 

\section{Prior Work}
Many online calculators provide step by step solutions to a problem however a difference between mine and other websites is my step by step solution will be user-inspired. Essentially the user will be writing out the step by step solution themselves. The new website however will be checking to see if the steps attempted are correct, along with that if a step is incorrect then the website will also provide guiding prompts to help get the student back on track towards the correct solution. 

With that being said, the other online calculators are helpful in showing what are helpful design elements and approaches towards creating this website. For example, Wolfram Alpha is not only capable of complicated computations it also has a clean design and an understandable interface. Another important online calculator that has been a big inspiration for my website is https://www.integral-calculator.com/. 

Aside from online calculators, there exists a Math Robot tutor that does provide real-time feedback for the student as well as providing why an answer is correct or not. This math robot is called ABii, along with the fully autonomous physical robot body it also has a comprehensive online math teaching program along side with it. A qualm with the ABii is  the price tag, the price of the ABii k-5 School Edition+ is $1499.00$. Although this robot can be a very useful teaching tool, this price makes it inaccessible to lower-income students or schools. 

Even with Wolfram Alpha to get access to the premium website has a monthly cost. Adding fees to these websites and tools automatically reduces the accessibility to education tools. As mentioned, math education is still developing. The implementation of new math tools can help with that development, but realistically only if those tools are accessible to all types of students. 

Now as for automated online math tutoring machines, I have found one that uses machine learning to really lean into the personalized teaching information. The website will attempt to become an intelligent tutoring system. An intelligent tutoring system have been made before, the definition for an intelligent tutoring system is a computer system that provides personalized and immediate feedback for a student.  

\section{Ethical Consideration}
 In the construction of an automated online math tutoring machine, there are ways to address some ethical concerns however it is not possible to provide a solution to all concerns on the one website. This is because when addressing one learning disability the implications could be negative for a different learning disability, other than learning disabilities educational websites are not optimal for accessibility, given the scope of this website only being able to solve algebraic problems this tool will concentrate the power to a small group of math students. 

Intelligent tutoring systems can be helpful in increasing the accessibility of tutoring to more people, especially if the website is free which mine will be. The website being free will remove any financial burden that may come with hiring a tutor. Utilizing the web platform will also allow the student to access the information and help at any time, and from anywhere which may be helpful for students with mobility issues. Although these systems can be helpful to some it does come with some pitfalls of being unable to provide everyone with everything they need for the website to be most successful. 

There are instances where an online intelligent tutoring system is not going to be beneficial for some students, due to various accessibility issues, cognitive and learning disorders, and physical impairments. At this point and time not everyone has access to the internet, and even if they do not everyone is knowledgeable about the internet and how some devices work. Websites inherently are not completely accessible.

Due to the lack of accessibility within the internet, the website will be monopolizing power to people who have access to the internet which is not an equally diverse group of people, along with that the website will be most easily accessible to those with computer literacy and are able to navigate the website from a compatible device. 

In an attempt to create a fully ethical website the designer should take into account all forms of where accessibility will be challenged and create a solution, however, a solution for one problem could create an entirely new problem for another people. To an extent the accessibility features can be user-customized but at what point will all forms of inaccessibility be challenged begging the question of technological solutionism. At the end of the day, in-person tutors came first, intelligent tutoring systems came afterward, if there a way to design a website full capable of the personalization an in-person tutor could provide?

\section{Methods}
This website will mainly be built in VS code, it is a ideal text editor to use due to the fact that it supports so many languages. Aside from just that it's interface is considered easy to use and understand for a beginner web developer. VS code utilizes smart bracket and contrasting colors to help coders as they work. Along with that VS code has a great function for AutoClose tag and Auto Rename Tag, do help reduce the struggles that come with generating tags and their children. Beyond just those elements there is smart indentation, settings that enforce consistent style when editing, and a large selection of color ways for the website all designed to help the web developer  \cite{gupta_vs_2019}

In VS Code I will be using CSS and HTML for the general web application development, however in those programs there are some important algorithms that will be used to create the overall experience of the website. For example the Shunting Yard Algorthm will be used to produce a stack for the order of operations to be preformed. The Shunting Yard Algorithm uses stacks and queues to hold the number values and the function operators. So, when looping through each element of the function if the element is a number it is put onto the output queue, and if it an operator of greater presedence than the previous one then it gets pushed onto the stack. If it is not of greater percendence then the current stack gets popped to the output queue and the new operator starts the new stack. Once Shunting Yard Algorithm is completed it produces the reverse polish notation of the function which will then be used to check a students work for accuracy.   

Once the Shunting yard algorithm is completed to check the students work I will be comparing whatever operation they are doing and seeing if it is the inverse of a current operation in the output queue that has just been made. If not the student will be prompted to try again, and it it is the the queue will be updated to reflect the missing operation. 



\section{Evaluation}
To evaluate the website I will need to check for three things, does the website work, is it usable and does the website succeed in its goal. 

The website works if it steers the student in the direction of the correct answer as opposed to simply proving the step by step. In doing so the website should be able to identify where a student made a mistake and then provide help getting it to the correct answer. To test this aspect I will use curate a set of commonly made errors in algebra to see if the website catches them and then properly addresses them.  %The Califorina standardized testing has a lot of this information 

Nest to see if the website is usable there are some key functionality items that need to be addressed. Such as can the website take in a mathematical input? Next can it recognize and problem it can solve, or a problem it cannot solve? Lastly does it provide the helpful guidance and is the math on the website readable? To check if my website can take in a mathematical problem I will be test inputting problems I know it can solve and problems I know it cannot solve. It should provide a response to the problems it cannot solve the student knows that this website unfortunately cannot help them with their problem. 

Testing the usefulness of the websites guiding questions will be tested more so in the question of did the app succeed in its goal. After providing the students with problem set to not only test their knowledge but also test the efficacy of the website I will also provide a set of qualitative questions to gauge the usefulness of the website for a student.



\begin{comment}
No definition citations, unless the term itself is in dispute
Separate problem background from technical background
    Unclear if games and apps require much technical background
    The general structure of the framework might be better suited for the Architecture Overview section
        Eg. Flask uses decorators to associate functions with URLs
        Eg. Unity has scripts associated with objects and specific triggers, such as walking into an area, pressing a button, etc.
    Maybe a better name is "algorithmic background"?
        Should explore what does and doesn't count
            All ML counts
            App and game frameworks do not
        Framework vs. library?
            I like the idea of [inversion of control](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/InversionOfControl.html), but that may be too abstract for students to understand
        Heuristic: is understanding that system necessary to understand the results?
            Ie. How Flask or Unity works doesn't influence whether the app/game is useful/fun/engaging
            But how (say) linear regression works is highly relevant for why the results match/don't match the actual values
